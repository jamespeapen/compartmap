# A wrapper function to generate a GRanges object of chromatin domain inflection points

A wrapper function to generate a GRanges object of chromatin domain
inflection points

## Usage

``` r
getDomainInflections(
  gr,
  what = "score",
  res = 1000000,
  chrs = c(paste0("chr", 1:22), "chrX"),
  genome = c("hg19", "hg38", "mm9", "mm10")
)
```

## Arguments

- gr:

  Input GRanges object with mcols column corresponding to chromatin
  domains

- what:

  The name of the column containing the chromatin domain information

- res:

  What resolution the domains were called

- chrs:

  Which chromosomes to work on

- genome:

  Which genome does the input data come from

## Value

A GRanges object of compartment inflection points

## Examples

``` r
data("k562_scrna_chr14", package = "compartmap")
chr14_domains <- scCompartments(k562_scrna_chr14,
  res = 1e6, genome = "hg19",
  group = TRUE, bootstrap = FALSE
)
