\usage{
CompartmentCall(pc, res, gr, name = NULL, unitarized = FALSE)

CompartmapCall(gr, res, name = NULL, unitarized = FALSE)

MultiCompartmentCall(ccalls, name, unitarized = FALSE, unitarize = FALSE)

scCompartmentCall(ccalls, res, name, unitarized = FALSE, unitarize = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pc}{The singular values from a compartment call}

\item{res}{The binning resolution used}

\item{gr}{The GRanges output of \code{scCompartments} or \code{getArrayCompartments}
containing the 'pc' column}

\item{name}{An identifier for this set of compartment calls}

\item{unitarized}{Whether the singular values have been unitarized}

\item{ccalls}{A \code{RaggedExperiment} of single-cell compartment calls}

\item{unitarize}{Whether to unitarize the singular values for each of the inputs calls}
}
\description{
These objects are S7 classes that hold compartment call values, and their
genomic region and resolution metadata as well as methods to aid analysis
and visualization. \code{CompartmentCall} is primarily a parent class from which
\code{CompartmapCall} and \code{MultiCompartmentCall} are derived. It is constucted
from a vector of the call values, a \code{GRanges} object of the bins, and the
resolution of the bins. It is also useful to compare singular
values/eigenvectors from Hi-C compartment analysis, given the bin
coordinates.
}
\details{
\code{CompartmapCall()} is constructed from the output of \code{scCompartments(group = TRUE)}. \code{MultiCompartmentCall()} holds multiple \code{CompartmapCall()} objects at
the same resolution. For single-cell level compartment inferences use
\code{scCompartmentCall()}. This class holds multiple single-cell level
compartment. This takes the RaggedExperiment from \code{scCompartments()} as its
input.
