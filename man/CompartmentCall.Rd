\description{
These S7 classes hold compartment call values, and their genomic region and
resolution metadata as well as methods to aid analysis and visualization.
\code{CompartmentCall()} is primarily a parent class from which
\code{CompartmapCall()} and \code{MultiCompartmapCall()} are derived.
}
\details{
\subsection{Objects}{

\code{CompartmentCall} is constucted from a vector of the call values, a
\code{GenomicRanges::GRanges()} object of the bins, and the resolution of the
bins. Given a \code{GRanges} of bin coordinates, it can be used to store singular
values/eigenvectors from Hi-C compartment analysis. Along with
\code{CompartmapCall} objects, they can be combined in a \code{MultiCompartmapCall} to
compare against each other. All \code{CompartmentCall} methods work on every
other \emph{compartmap} S7 object.

\code{CompartmapCall()} is constructed from the \code{GRanges} output of
\code{scCompartments(group = TRUE)}. \code{MultiCompartmapCall()} holds multiple
\code{CompartmapCall()} objects at the same resolution, and is constructed with a
list of \code{CompartmentCall} or \code{CompartmapCall} objects.

For single-cell level compartment inferences use \code{scCompartmapCall()}, which
inherits from \code{MultiCompartmapCall}. This class holds multiple single-cell
level compartment calls, taking the \code{RaggedExperiment::RaggedExperiment()}
from \code{scCompartments()} as its constructor. Since it inherits from
\code{MultiCompartmapCall}, all \code{MultiCompartmapCall} methods work on
\code{scCompartmapCall} objects.

All objects may be subset to required indices with \verb{object[row indices, column indices]}. Their dimensions can be accessed with \code{dim()}, \code{nrow()}
and \code{ncol()}.

\subsection{Properties and accessors}{

These properties may be accessed with \code{@} like S4 slots, or using their
accessor functions. Some functions share methods with other Bioconductor
classes like \code{GRanges} and \code{SummarizedExperiment}.
\itemize{
\item \code{name}, \code{get_name()}: The name of the object, used to identify it, useful
when making \code{MultiCompartmapCall} objects
\item \code{gr}, \code{granges()}: A \code{GRanges} object of the compartment bins
\item \code{df}, \code{DF()}: a \code{data.table} of bin indices in column \code{n} and compartment
call singular values in column \code{pc}. For \code{MultiCompartmapCall} and
\code{scCompartmapCall} objects, this is in a tidy format, with an additional
\code{name} column.
\item \code{res}, \code{resolution()}: The genomic resolution at which the compartments
were called
\item \code{unitarized}, \code{is_unitarized()}: Whether the singular values have been
unitarized
\item \code{seqinfo}, \code{seqinfo()}: Seqinfo for the object's \code{GRanges}
\item \code{mat}, \code{mat()}: A matrix of genomic bins by singular values - a wide
matrix format of the \code{df} slot. This is used to calculate correlation and
agreement between cells in a \code{scCompartmapCall} and groups in a
\code{MultiCompartmapCall} object.
